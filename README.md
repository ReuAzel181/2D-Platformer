# Evergreen Odyssey a 2D Game Platformer

Welcome to the 2D Game Platformer project! This repository contains the source code and assets for a simple 2D platformer game developed in Unity. The game features a player character that can navigate through various levels, interact with different objects, and face challenges.

## Features

- **Platformer Gameplay:** Classic 2D platformer mechanics with jumping, running, and obstacle navigation.
- **Level Generation:** Dynamic level generation with randomly selected tiles.
- **Player Interaction:** Basic player controls with collision detection.
- **Tile System:** Prefabs for different tiles that are used to create the game world.

## Game Components

### LevelGenerator.cs
- This script handles the procedural generation of game levels by spawning tiles based on player position. Key functionalities include:

 - Tile Prefabs: Array of tile prefabs used for level generation.
 - Player Detection: Spawns new tiles when the player approaches the edge of the current level.
 - Debugging: Logs the positions of tiles for troubleshooting.

## Player Controls
  - Basic player controls are implemented to allow movement and interaction with the game environment. The player can move left, right, and jump across platforms.

## Tile Prefabs
  - The game uses prefabricated tiles to build levels. Each tile prefab contains:
      Visual Elements: Graphics and animations for the tile.
      EndP Marker: A marker to indicate the end of the tile for proper placement during level generation.
